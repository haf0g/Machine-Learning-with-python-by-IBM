## Course Overview

The course covers essential topics in machine learning, including:

- Different types of machine learning approaches (supervised and unsupervised learning)  
- Core algorithms such as regression, classification, and clustering  
- Model evaluation and improvement methods  
- Hands-on programming with Python libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`

## Current Modules Included
### Module 3 : Regression and Classification Notebooks
- Simple Linear Regression  
- Multiple Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Multi-class Classification
- 
### Module 4 : Regression and Classification Notebooks
