## Course Overview

The course covers essential topics in machine learning, including:

- Different types of machine learning approaches (supervised and unsupervised learning)  
- Core algorithms such as regression, classification, and clustering  
- Model evaluation and improvement methods  
- Hands-on programming with Python libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`  

---

## Current Modules Included

### Module 4: Regression
- Introduction to Regression  
- Simple Linear Regression  
- Multiple Linear Regression  
- Polynomial and Non-Linear Regression  
- Introduction to Logistic Regression  
- Training a Logistic Regression Model  

*(Additional modules will be added as I progress through the course)*
